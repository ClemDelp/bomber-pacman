- [Meteor]() for the server side because... everything is so simple with meteor ;-)
- [React]() & [Redux]() combo for the frontend
- [Phaser.js]() for the game engine itself

[react-redux-meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/ClemDelp/react-redux-meteor-boilerplate) was used to generate the very basic structure (boilerplate inception!)

## Procedural Map Generation

[heightmap-generator](https://github.com/ClemDelp/heightmap-generator) is used to generate the map
